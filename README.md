# The cmd_calculator
One cool calculator in your cmd

## Why
I had time over and updated an old project with just one function. To add to numbers, now when I have upgraded it so you can subbstract, multiply and some more. Now when it's better and more funtional I post it here on Github.

## How to run    
To run it you need to have python on your computer, you can download it [on this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After that you need to start it by in for directing in cmd to the place where you have the calculotor or use a file explorer trick. When you have in cmd gone to the location of the calculator type: `python calc.py` to start it.

After all that you can start to calculator but you can only use: + , - , * and /. So for example if I want to add 5 and 6 I will type `5 + 6`, it important to have a space in between the numbers and the type of type of calculation or it will be an error.

Have a good day
